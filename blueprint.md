# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the style, design, and features of a multi-page Flutter application for event exploration and social planning.

## Style and Design

-   **Theme:** Modern, visually balanced layout with clean spacing.
-   **Color Palette:** Vibrant and energetic with a wide range of hues.
-   **Typography:** Expressive and hierarchical, with clear emphasis on titles, headlines, and important text.
-   **Iconography:** Modern and intuitive icons to enhance user understanding and navigation.
-   **Visual Effects:** Subtle noise texture on the main background, multi-layered drop shadows for depth, and "glow" effects on interactive elements.
-   **Interactivity:** Polished and responsive UI components (buttons, text fields, etc.) with clear visual feedback.
-   **Accessibility:** Adherence to a11y standards to ensure the app is usable by a wide variety of users.

## Implemented Features

### Navigation

-   **Bottom Navigation Bar:** Provides easy access to the five main screens of the application.

### Screens

1.  **Event Exploration:** Displays a feed of events with search and filter capabilities.
2.  **Event Details:** Shows detailed information about a selected event, including a map, attendance options, and a comment section.
3.  **Create Plan with Friends:** Allows users to select friends, write a message, and send an invitation to an event.
4.  **User Profile:** Displays the user's saved events, attended events, and account settings.
5.  **Publish New Event:** A form for users to create and publish their own events.

## Current Plan

-   Implement placeholder screens for each of the five main features.
-   Ensure the project is well-organized and follows Flutter best practices.
